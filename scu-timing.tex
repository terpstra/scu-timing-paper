\begin{abstract}
The standard equipment controller under development for the new FAIR
accelerator facility is the Scalable Control Unit (SCU). It is designed to
synchronize and control the actions of up to 12 purpose-built slave cards,
connected in a propritary crate by a parallel backplane. Inter-crate
coordination and facility-wide synchronization are a core FAIR requirement
and thus precise timing of SCU slave actions is of vital importance.

The SCU consists primarily of two components, an x86 COM Express daughter
board and a carrier board with an Altera Arria II GX FPGA, interconnected by
PCI Express. The x86 receives configuration and set values with which it
programs the real-time event-condition-action (ECA) unit in the FPGA. The
ECA unit receives event messages via the timing network, which also
synchronizes the clocks of all SCUs in the facility using White Rabbit.
Matching events trigger actions on the SCU slave cards such as: ramping
magnets, triggering kickers, etc.

Timing requirements differ depending on the action taken. For softer
real-time actions, an interrupt can be generated for complex processing on
the x86. Alternatively, the FPGA can directly fire a pulse out a LEMO output
or an immediate SCU bus operation. The delay and synchronization achievable
in each case differs and this paper examines the timing performance of each
to determine which approach is appropriate for the required actions.
